# Deep Learning Project
The repository contains two projects for EPFL Deep Learning course (EE-559), Summer 2019.

# Project 1 – Classification, weight sharing, auxiliary losses:
The objective of this project is to test different architectures to compare two digits visible in a two-channel image. It aims at showing in particular the impact of weight sharing, and of the use of an auxiliary loss to help the training of the main objective.

# Project 2 – Mini deep-learning framework: 
The objective of this project is to design a mini “deep learning framework” using only pytorch’s tensor operations and the standard math library, hence in particular without using autograd or the neural-network modules.
